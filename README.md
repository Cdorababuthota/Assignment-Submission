Assignment :
From the dataset, could you create plots using plotly (https://plotly.com/) showing how the following battery paramaters are changing as the battery cell is aging through charge/discharge cycles.
Hereâ€™s a description of the assignment and the approach used in the code:
Assignment Description: 
The objective of this assignment is to analyze the aging process of Li-ion batteries by examining how key parameters change over multiple charge and discharge cycles. The data includes impedance measurements obtained through Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) across a frequency range of 0.1Hz to 5kHz. The focus is on visualizing the following battery parameters: Battery Impedance, Estimated Electrolyte Resistance (Re), and Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct), which provide valuable insights into the internal condition of the battery as it ages.
Code Explanation and Solution: 
The code loads a dataset containing battery performance data and performs the following steps:
1.	Data Inspection: The code starts by inspecting the dataset, checking for the presence of the required columns: Cycle, Battery_Impedance, Estimated_Electrolyte_Resistance, and Rct_Charge_Transfer_Resistance. It ensures that the data is structured correctly.
2.	Column Validation: The code checks if the relevant columns exist. If any are missing, it prints a message indicating which columns are unavailable.
3.	Plotting: The code uses Plotly, a popular plotting library, to visualize how the battery parameters evolve across the cycles:
o	A line plot is created for each of the key parameters (Impedance, Electrolyte Resistance, and Charge Transfer Resistance) versus the cycle number.
o	The plot is customized with titles and axis labels to clearly represent the aging process of the battery.
4.	Subplots: A subplot layout is used to display multiple plots in a single figure for easy comparison of the different parameters.
5.	Output: The plots are displayed interactively within the environment. If interactive visualization fails, the plot is saved as an HTML file that can be viewed in a browser.
